# My DHDK Portfolio
This repository hosts the links to the projects' repositories and websites that have been developed for the courses of the master's degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) of the University of Bologna.
>**Note**<br>
>**Some projects have not been completed yet and some others do not have a presentational website. The latter case depends on the purpose of the project (e.g. it could be when the aim is to develop a software).**
